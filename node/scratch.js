// Variables
// Declared, using very specific words. 

// let - a mutable variable, the value can be change. This may be reassigned

// = is the assignment operator, this does not represent equality
let myName = "Kyle" // String begins with ",',` and contains characters 

// const - is an immutable variable, meaning it cannot be reassigned
const theSky = "is blue"

// var - is mutable, and is contained in the global scope.
// It receives the super power of hoisting 
var thing = "hoisted"
